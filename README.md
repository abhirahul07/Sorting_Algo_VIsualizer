# Sorting Visualizer

## Overview
This project is a visualizer for various sorting algorithms, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The interface allows users to generate an array of random values, adjust the array size and sorting speed, and visualize different sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.

## Features
- **Interactive UI**: Adjust the size of the array and the speed of the sorting algorithm.
- **Algorithm Selection**: Choose from multiple sorting algorithms to visualize.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes for a consistent experience across devices.
- **Time and Space Complexity Display**: View the time and space complexities for the selected sorting algorithm.

## Live Demo

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For the structure of the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For the logic behind sorting algorithms and DOM manipulation.
